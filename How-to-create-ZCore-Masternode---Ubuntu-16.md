 ## **Requirements:**

5000 ZCR

Dedicated IP

Port 17291 Available

Wallet ready, if you use linux [compile it](https://github.com/zcore-coin/source-code/wiki/How-to-compile-ZCore-on-Linux)

(we will use zcored to rpc server and zcore-cli to rpc client)




### 1) Make sure you know where is your ZCore data folder:

` Linux`
`./home/<your_user>/.zcore`   



### 2) In the wallet binary folder, execute:

`./zcore-cli getaccountaddress mn1`



### 3) In the same folder, execute:

`./zcore-cli masternode genkey`

Save this key, we'll use it later



### 4) Now send exactly 5000 ZCR to the address generated at the 2nd step

### 5) Wait 15 confirmations 

### 6) Now lets get the txid with the following command:

`./zcore-cli masternode outputs`



### 7) If you waited 15 confirmations previously, close the wallet:

`./zcore-cli stop`



### 8) In the folder of the 1st step, create an file or open it, with the name: zcore.conf

### 9) In the zcore.conf file, change or insert this lines:

```
rpcuser={ANY USER OF YOUR CHOICE}
rpcpassword={ANY PASSWORD OF YOUR CHOICE}
listen=1
server=1
daemon=1
logtimestamps=1
maxconnections=256
masternode=1
masternodeprivkey={GENKEY}
bind={EXTERNAL IP}:17291
```
 
Make sure that your **GENKEY** is the same generated in the 3rd step
 
And the **EXTERNAL IP** must be a dedicated one, otherwise it wont work.

### 10) Now start your wallet and check for the masternode status:
`./zcore-cli masternode status`
