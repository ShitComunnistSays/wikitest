## Problem
Since all Masternode IP address is visible in all wallets, it's possible that someone try to attack one or many. 
Like a 51% Attack ( never happen in NeoScrypt algorithm).

Depending of your VPS specifications, it could restart and you'd lose some coins, till it turn on again.
***

## Solution
Using few softwares, it's possible to mitigate some of this attacks, but it's always recommended to rent a CloudFlare or purchase your hosting DDoS protection (Around $10).
***

## Required
FirewallD 

Fail2Ban

***
## Installing FirewallD

Fedora

`sudo dnf install -y firewalld # Probably already installed`

CentOS or RHEL...

`sudo yum install -y firewalld # Probably already installed`

Debian or Ubuntu

`sudo apt install -y firewalld`


## Setting IPTABLES

Mask iptables

```
sudo systemctl disable iptables.service
sudo systemctl mask iptables.service
```

Setting firewall
Is firewalld running? If not, turn it on.
```
sudo firewall-cmd --state
sudo systemctl start firewalld.service
```

Enable firewalld to start upon boot.
```
sudo systemctl enable firewalld.service
```

Determine what the default zone is.
```
sudo firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zone
```

Take a look at the configuration as it stands now.
```
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
```

Add and remove base services.
```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service ssh
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service dhcpv6-client
// sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service cockpit - not used in fedora
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service cockpit
```

Open Masternode port
```
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=17291/tcp
```

Final configuration
```
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
sudo firewall-cmd --state
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
```

We are done here.

## Installing Fail2Ban

Utility:
Fail2Ban verify for bad requests, or hackers trying to attack your vps.

Fedora
```
sudo dnf install -y fail2ban fail2ban-systemd
```

CentOS or RHEL
```
sudo yum install epel-release # if not already installed
sudo yum install -y fail2ban fail2ban-systemd
```
Debian or Ubuntu
```
sudo apt install -y fail2ban
```

If you are not using FirewallD, and instead are using IPTables for your firewall, uninstall fail2ban-firewalld (for the Red Hat-based systems only).

`sudo dnf remove -y fail2ban-firewalld # Fedora`
`sudo yum remove -y fail2ban-firewalld # CentOS or RHEL`

## Configuring Fail2Ban

Edit `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/local.conf` or `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local`
Copy, Paste and save:
```
[DEFAULT]
# Ban hosts for one hour:
bantime = 3600

# Flip the comments here if you use iptables instead of firewalld
#banaction = iptables-multiport
banaction = firewallcmd-ipset

# Enable logging to the systemd journal
backend = systemd

[sshd]
enabled = true
```

### Enable Fail2Ban and reboot
```
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
```

### Analyzing
```
# Watch the IP addresses slowly pile up by occassionally looking in the SSH jail...
sudo fail2ban-client status sshd
```
```
# Also watch...
sudo journalctl -u fail2ban.service -f
```
```
# ...and...
sudo tail -F /var/log/fail2ban.log 
```
